CWAC_ActiveRecord

This is a very simple implementation of the ActiveRecord pattern for PHP5.
It is currently tested with MySQL and at least two parties use it actively
in production systems. It is designed for speed and ease of use, not academic
purity.

The main codebase is from 2007 and not really actively maintained (it works
for the involved parties). If anything, expect only tiny bugfixes. Yes, there
some small bugs that are so far considered non-critical. One fine day, someone
might do something about them. Or not. We'll see.

ActiveRecord is suitable if you need something that's very simple and quick
to setup, and does not waste too much memory and CPU cycles on abstraction
where you need none.

For everything else, go and use Propel or Doctrine2. If you have never used
ActiveRecord or any other kind of database access layer, go and use Propel
or Doctrine2. The ActiveRecord pattern can lead to dangerous coding style
when used improperly. It can also make you blind, deaf and/or sterile.
If you're looking for something that's actively maintained, go use Propel
or Doctrine2. Got the message? :-)
